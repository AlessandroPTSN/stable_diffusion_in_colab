# Stable diffusion 
So, first of all...

## What is stable diffusion?
Stable Diffusion is a software that generates images through artificial intelligence fed by an image bank with multiple descriptions used as a reference in the production of new images.

AUTOMATIC1111 (A1111 for short) Stable Diffusion webui is the web interface where users can use stable diffusion on a more user friendly platform.  
You can use AUTOMATIC1111 on Google Colab , Windows or Mac, however, in this repository we will focus on how to use GUI AUTOTMATIC1111 on google colab.

# What is the webui for
To use it, just run the stable_in_webui.ipynb file, it already has some models listed, and other models from other sources can be added (such as hugging_face or civitai).  
If you want to create your own model, we recommend opening the train_model.ipynb file, it is already configured for creating a custom model.
